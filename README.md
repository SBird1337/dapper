# dapper
Docker image of Ubuntu Version 6.06 Dapper Drake

Please note that this is an experimental repository, mainly meant to build very old software. The lifetime of Dapper Drake has ended and there are no security related updates for critical vulnerabilities, and this image should not be used in a live, productive environment.

Also note that due to dockerhub currently not supporting git large file storage, this build cannot be automated, so the image may diverge from the release and master branch, though I tend to update changes immediately.
